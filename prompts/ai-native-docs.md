# AI-Native Documentation Philosophy

This document reveals the revolutionary shift from human-centric to AI-native documentation. Traditional docs explain "how" - AI-native docs reveal "why." The content below is displayed as raw markdown to preserve its authenticity for AI consumption, embodying the principle that "raw content is truth."
